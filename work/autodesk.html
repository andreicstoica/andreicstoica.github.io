                        <p>Synthesis is an Autodesk simulator and emulator targeted towards high-school robotics students. Each summer, a group of around 12 high-school and college interns continue working on the product.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Because of the small nature of the team, I had three main roles. Officially in charge of marketing and everything 'non-dev,' I also managed the user side of the product. I organized 'Autodesk Days' (pictured below) in Portland, Michigan, Montreal, and online. Over 100 students joined us in these feedback sessions during summer break – their feedback inspired a UI/UX redesign, which I helped lead.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I also worked on a few side projects – one of which was helping design a new museum exhibit at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI). OMSI wanted to inspire elementary school aged kids to think about design. They approached Autodesk to make a custom library in Tinkercad that would run on iPads in the exhibit, where kids could easily drag and drop different furniture pieces to create environments that 'fostered communication.' <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/omsi-tinkercad-partner-on-innovation-stations">Click on this link to see Tinkercad's official blog post</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Working alongside Autodesk employees stationed all over the world taught me numerous lessons on PMing, UX research, and UI design that I will carry with me into my professional career.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Update June 2020:</b> I also made a quick 'Day in the Life' type video to advertise the internship program, which is now live! <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/TGAJW3aCo8Y">Click on this link to see the YouTube video.</a></p>
