                        <p>BlocPower helps underserved communities retrofit old heating and cooling systems and install new wi-fi and solar systems through unique financing models and by working with city governments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My work mainly aligned with a company OKR of increasing 'intake survey' click-through rates. As a product intern, I was tasked with reworking the website. After installing Hotjar (analytics and heatmapping software) on the website, it was clear that there was a lot to work on. I proposed an entire site redesign (<a target="_blank" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/81f59cb9-3455-4675-8e41-95a4a4b36837-d4a6/">link to mockups</a>), which highlighted the need to segment information (landing pages) to different visitors (types of customers). After some hesitation from the CEO, I built three new pillar-pages part of my redesign in Webflow to prove my hypothesis. The pages performeed exceptionally well, and with these metrics, BlocPower's Head of Product and I proposed a new website redesign <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kbc7KTzXPrRkMvZW9WART74kjkXoZa9O/view">with a product specification document</a>. This convinced the CEO to contact web-dev agencies to contract the production of a completely new site.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I also worked closely with the growth marketing team to create campaign specific landing pages to sync with BlocPower's new HubSpot subscription and nationwide ad campaign.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Update March 2023:</b> With the close of a new fundraising round, BlocPower has launched its new design language and marketing campaigns - including a refreshed website. This work began during my summer internship, and I am excited to finally see it live!</p>
